### The additional npms:

```
> npm install sass
> npm install firebase
```


# Go to https://firebase.google.com/

In the upper portion of the page "Go to console" 
* Here either select an existing project or create/Add a new one

In the upper righthand corner select the cog wheel next to "Project Overview"
* Then select "Project settings"

Scroll to the bottom of the page and if no app has been created, select the button to create 
a new web app.  It looks sort'a like an empty HTML tag (</>)

Then name it whatever you'd like
